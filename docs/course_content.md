# Intro
This page contains an outline of the course. 

# Chapters

## 1. NLP Basics
The more "traditional" NLP techinques: tokenising, lemmatising, vectorising, n-gram, TF-IDF etc. Some of the techniques are not practical anymore but they are still crucial for understanding how and why the more "modern" NLP techinques work. 

Go to [this page](nlp_basics.md) to get started. 

## 2. Word Embeddings
Word embedding was one of the first steps of NLP model go "big" and "neural". Here we will explore utilising word embeddings to enhance your NLP models. 

Go to [this page](word_embedding.md) to get started. 

## 3. Context Aware Embedding
Feature engineering is huge part of NLP, once we get text into vectorised representation (embedding), the rest is pretty straightforward. More advanced NLP models are much better at generating said "embeddings". In this chapter, you will try a better NLP model and compare the results to your previous results with more "traditional" methods. 

Go to [this page](context_aware_embedding.md) to get started. 


## 4. Transfer Learning and Fine-tuning
WIP

## 5. Pre-trained Pipelines
There are pre-trained, pre-built, ready-to-use pipeline out there that will greatly simplify some standard NLP tasks for you. We will try some of them in this chapter. And compare the results to your previous models. 

Go to [this page](pre-trained_pipeline.md) to get started.
