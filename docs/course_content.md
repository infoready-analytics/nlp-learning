## 1. NLP Basics
The more "traditional" NLP techinques: tokenising, lemmatising, vectorising, n-gram, TF-IDF etc. Some of the techniques are not practical anymore but they are still crucial for understanding how and why the more "modern" NLP techinques work.

## 2. Word Embeddings
Word embedding was one of the first steps of NLP model go "big" and "neural". Here we will explore utilising word embeddings to enhance your NLP models. 

Go to [this page](word_embedding.md) to get started. 

## 3. Context Aware Embedding
Feature engineering is huge part of NLP, once we get text into vectorised representation (embedding), the rest is pretty straightforward. More advanced NLP models are much better at generating said "embeddings". In this chapter, you will try a better NLP model and compare the results to your previous results with more "traditional" methods.

## 4. Transfer Learning and Fine-tuning
The utilisation of transfer learning was a big step forward for deep learning in NLP. Most of the state of the art models in the past few years utilised transfer learning. In this chapter we will explore how transfer learning works in practice.

## 5. Pre-trained Models
In the right circumstances, utilising the right type of pre-trained NLP models could greatly boost productivity. They come in different flavours: saved model weights that you could download, or cloud hosted models that expose a few API endpoints. We will explore a few examples in this chapter. 

Go to [this page](pre-trained_models.md) to get started. 

## 6. Topic Modelling
So far we have been playing in the supervised territory. As an example, sentiment classification has a clear goal and benchmark in mind. There are times we have zero idea about the text data, and we want to explore and produce some initial insights. Topic modelling is usually where we start.
