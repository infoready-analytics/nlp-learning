# Intro
This page contains an outline of the course. 

# NLP Basics
The more "traditional" NLP techinques: tokenising, lemmatising, vectorising, n-gram, TF-IDF etc. Some of the techniques are not practical anymore but they are still crucial for understanding how and why the more "modern" NLP techinques work.

# word2vec Embedding
word2vec was one of the first steps of NLP model go "big" and "neural". Here we will explore utilising word2vec embeddings to enhance your NLP models. 

Go to [this page](word2vec.md) to get started. 

# Modern Embedding
Feature engineering is huge part of NLP, once we get text into vectorised representation (embedding), the rest is pretty straightforward. "Modern" NLP models are much better at generating said "embeddings". In this section, you will try a modern NLP model generated embedding and compare the results to your previous results with more "traditional" methods. 

Go to [this page](modern_embedding.md) to get started. 

# Pre-trained Pipelines
There are pre-trained, pre-built, ready-to-use pipeline out there that will magically perform some standard NLP tasks for you. We will try some of them in this section. And compare the results to your previous models. 

Go to [this page](pre-trained_pipeline.md) to get started.
